-- this more or less was insipred by Pokermon and when I mean inspired I mean basically 
-- I ripped of stuff from that mod and probably the code (I'm writing this down before coding everthing)
-- I'm god awful at coding and I'm somehow studying computer engineering (to be fair I never coded on lua)
-- go play the mod (specialy since there's a chance that nintendo might take it down):
