**THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**

>***Phew... What a shift!***
>
>*Here at one of our establishments, our employees will enjoy one of our patented, top-of-the-line breakrooms. Filled with the most comfortable furniture in the state, a coffee machine with the finest hot coffee made by our 4.5-star chefs, and our snack machine filled with the best snacks from town.*
>
>*Not only that, our breakrooms contain the best recreation for our employees, such as cable TV, a Fazbear™ pimball machine, and our patented Fazbear™ exclusive **Video Poker Machine**™ for our employees who feel a little lucky!*

><sup>*Employees are only allowed to play during their 15-minute break. Afterward, they are demanded to leave the breakroom and return to their shift or else they suffer a warning by management, resulting in punishment such as: revoked break privileges, docked salary, disciplinary actions, unpaid overtime or being fired.*</sup>
